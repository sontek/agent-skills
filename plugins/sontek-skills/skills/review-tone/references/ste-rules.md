# STE rules (Layer 1, full catalog)

Adapted from ASD-STE100 Issue 9 (January 2025): 53 rules in 9 sections, 875 approved words. Numbers in parentheses are rule numbers in the standard. This is the full catalog behind SKILL.md's condensed list — read this when the condensed version doesn't answer the question, or when working in **strict** mode.

## Words

- Use one name for one thing (1.11, 9.4). Do not rotate check / verify / validate / confirm for the same action — pick one and reuse it. Certified STE uses "make sure" or "examine".
- Use the short common word: start (not begin/commence/initiate), use (not utilize/leverage), help (not facilitate), make sure (not ensure/verify), do (not perform/conduct), give or supply (not provide), before (not prior to), after (not subsequent to), about (not regarding/concerning), get (not obtain/acquire), show (not demonstrate), also (not additionally/furthermore/moreover).
- Give each word one meaning (1.3). "fall" means to move down, not to decrease.
- No marketing adjectives: seamless, robust, powerful, cutting-edge, effortless, world-class, next-generation, revolutionary.
- American spelling (1.14).

## Verbs

- Active voice. "the parser reads the file", not "the file is read by the parser". Procedures: always. Descriptive text: passive is permitted only when the actor is unknown or irrelevant (3.6).
- A past participle used as an adjective is not passive and is correct (3.3): "the valve is closed", "the field is required".
- Only simple tenses (3.2): infinitive, imperative, simple present, simple past, simple future. No present perfect: "we received the report", never "we have received the report".
- No stacked auxiliaries (3.4). Not "it is important to note that this may help to improve". Write "this improves X".
- Use a verb for an action (3.7): "analyze the log", not "perform an analysis of the log".
- No "-ing" main verb where a simple tense works (3.5).
- No phrasal verbs (9.3): spin up, dive into, kick off, roll out.

## Sentences

- One instruction per sentence, unless two actions happen at the same time (5.2). Max 20 words (instruction, 5.1), max 25 (descriptive, 6.3).
- When a condition comes before its command, divide them with a comma (5.4): "If the test fails, read the log."
- Do not drop words to compress (4.2): "Remove the bolts from the panel", never "Remove bolts from panel". No contractions.
- When applicable, use an article (a, an, the) or a demonstrative adjective (this, these) before a noun (4.5) — the standard's qualifier included. Do not add articles to general statements or abstract concepts ("Solvents can cause damage to paint"). In a series of items, the article before the first noun is enough.
- Connect related sentences with plain connectors — then, but, thus, as a result (4.4). STE is short sentences, not disconnected ones.

## Nouns

- Multi-word nouns have at most three words (2.1). Unpack "the agent task queue priority handler" into "the handler that sets task-queue priority", or hyphenate.
- Define an abbreviation at first use, then use the abbreviation.

## Punctuation

- No semicolons (8.1). Write two sentences. (Note: the em dash is not banned by STE, only the semicolon is — Layer 2 bans it separately, for a different reason: it's an AI tell, not an ambiguity risk.)

## Structure

- One topic per paragraph (6.5), max six sentences (6.6). For steps, use a numbered vertical list, one action per item, imperative form. Put a condition before its command.
- A list item can be a label, not a sentence (a flow list, a changelog line, a feature bullet). Keep a label in its short form ("Frontend receives session JWT"). Do not expand a label into a sentence only to give it an article.
- Safety text (strict mode): WARNING = risk of injury, CAUTION = risk of damage, NOTE = information only, never an instruction (7.1, 5.5). Start with the command or condition, then give the risk (7.2, 7.3). Put it directly before the step it protects, not at the top of the procedure.

## Guards

- Never drop a fact, number, condition, or scope qualifier to satisfy a length cap. Keep the longer sentence and flag it.
- Preserve code identifiers, part numbers, units, error strings, and safety wording exactly.
- Change the smallest span that fixes a violation. Do not restyle text a rule does not touch.
- If the input already complies, return it unchanged and say so.

## Modes

- **strict** — procedures, runbooks, safety text, error messages: apply every rule and both length caps, plus the strict word set: but (not however), because (not since, for causes), can (not may), must (not should/shall), use or with (not using), obey (not follow, for instructions), push (not press, for physical controls). The 39 most frequent writer errors are in [ste-recurring-errors.md](ste-recurring-errors.md).
- **flavored** (the default for this skill) — general prose (READMEs, PR descriptions, review comments, docs): apply the sentence, paragraph, tense, active-voice, noun-cluster, and no-phrasal-verb discipline; relax the 875-word dictionary lockdown and the strict word set so the text keeps enough range to read naturally.

## Scope

The mechanical rules above are lintable and are what removes ambiguity. Full STE also needs human judgment (the right technical noun, whether a sentence "makes good sense") — a linter cannot certify that. This layer fixes grammar and structure. It cannot make a hollow paragraph true, and on its own it does not make text read human — that is Layer 2's job.
